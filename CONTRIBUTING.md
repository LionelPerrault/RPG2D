At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on pull requests within three business days (and, typically, one business day). We may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Write tests.
* Follow our [style guide][style].

[style]: https://github.com/airbnb/javascript
[commit]: http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html

## Code conventions

We have ESLint to check for style in the JavaScript and .vue files. Before you commit, please run a check and auto-fix before submitting a pull-request.

We use [AirBnB's JavaScript guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) to keep the codebase all in one cohesive format. Having an editor like Microsoft's [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) will help check for ESLint mistakes as you write code. It is highly recommended.

### Contribution Tools
We are in the process of adding these tools to help make the process of contributing and in general easier in the future.

- Sass Style checking (CSS)
- Commit checks. Check for style issues before commiting.
- Unit tests within Vue components
